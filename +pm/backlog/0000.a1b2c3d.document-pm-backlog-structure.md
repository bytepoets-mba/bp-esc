# Document PM Backlog Structure

## Priority: 0000

## Description

Create and document the PM folder structure for managing PRD and backlog items. The +pm folder will contain markdown files for backlog items with the format: priority.hash.short-description.md where priority is an integer (lower number = higher priority), hash is a unique identifier, and short-description is a brief name.

## Details

- Folder location: +pm
- File naming convention: [priority].[hash].[short-description].md
- Content: Each file contains detailed backlog item information including title, description, priority, and any additional requirements.

This backlog item serves as documentation for the system itself.
