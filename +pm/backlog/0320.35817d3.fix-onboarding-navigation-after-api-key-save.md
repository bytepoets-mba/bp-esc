# Title: fix-onboarding-navigation-after-api-key-save

## Description
When the app is first installed/started and no API key is set, the onboarding screen appears. After entering the OpenRouter API key and clicking "Save":
- The key is saved successfully (confirmed by manual restart).
- The user is NOT forwarded to the main balance window.
- The UI stays on the onboarding screen, and nothing appears to happen.
- Restarting the app fixes it (it correctly detects the key and shows the main window).

## Expected Behavior
Upon clicking "Save", the app should:
1. Save the key (already working).
2. Immediately transition from the onboarding/setup view to the main balance monitoring view without requiring a restart.

## Root Cause Hypotheses
1. **State Management**: The UI state tracking whether the app is "configured" isn't being updated reactively after the `save_api_key` command returns.
2. **Missing Navigation Logic**: The frontend click handler might be calling the backend command but lacks the subsequent redirect or view-toggle logic.
3. **Event Handling**: The main window might be waiting for an event that isn't being fired after initial setup.

## Additional Requirements
- [ ] Investigate `src/app.js` for the "Save" button click handler.
- [ ] Ensure the UI state is updated or a page transition is triggered upon successful save.
- [ ] Test the onboarding flow by deleting `~/.config/bpesc-balance/.env` locally.
